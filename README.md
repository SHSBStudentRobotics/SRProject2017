# SRProject2017
The program we used for the student robotics competition in 2017.

Their are multiple duplicate files (as we didnt use version control properly), but the files that are actually 
used are: robot.py , decisionBackup.py, action.py and hardware.py. Be warned that the hardware and python api 
was different last year, so this code will not necessarily work without being modified.
